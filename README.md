# Tetriplan

Tetriplan is a productivity app focused on time-blocking, making use of AI to streamline adding and categorising tasks.

You can find a deployed version of the app here: [Tetriplan](https://tetriplan.netlify.app/)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Features

- Google sign with firebase
- Drag and drop time-blocking, event editing

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Deployment

When deploying the app to the hosting service (we have used Netlify). Ensure that the environment variables are correctly uploaded on the service. You will need both a firebase api key and a hugging face api key to make use of google authentication and category suggestions respectively.
